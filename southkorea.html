                <h1>Gyeongbokgung Palace</h1>
                <p>Gyeongbokgung Palace is a historic royal palace located in the heart of Seoul, South Korea. Built in 1395 during the Joseon Dynasty, it is the largest and most iconic of the Five Grand Palaces in Seoul. The palace served as the main royal residence and the seat of government for centuries. Gyeongbokgung, which means "Palace Greatly Blessed by Heaven," is renowned for its beautiful architecture, intricate design, and expansive grounds, which include stunning gardens, pavilions, and gates.

                    One of the palace's most famous features is the Gwanghwamun Gate, the main entrance that leads to a series of impressive buildings, including the Throne Hall (Geunjeongjeon) and the royal quarters. The palace complex also houses the National Palace Museum of Korea and the National Folk Museum, where visitors can learn about Korean history and culture.
                    
                    The changing of the guard ceremony, held at the main gate, is a popular attraction for tourists and showcases traditional Korean military attire and rituals. Despite suffering damage and destruction over the centuries, especially during the Japanese occupation, Gyeongbokgung has been meticulously restored and remains a symbol of Korean heritage and history. It is a must-visit site for anyone interested in the rich cultural legacy of South Korea..</p>
